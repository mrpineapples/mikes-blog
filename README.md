# Mike's Blog
A simple blog using react on the frontend and express on the backend. Right now blog posts are not stored in a database, they are stored locally on the express server so once the server is shut down all posts will go away. I created this app with the intention of expanding my skills and consider it a work in progress.

## Getting Started
Clone repo and in both the frontend and backend directories run:

```
yarn
yarn start
```
